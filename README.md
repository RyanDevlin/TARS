## What is this?

This repository conatins the code for the TARS project; a smart fully customizable smart mirror. The mirror uses Resin.io to control handle code additions as well as remote control. The app itself is written in javascript with an html/css UI built on Electronjs.

I created this project because I wanted to build what I envision as the perfect smart mirror. There are several publicly available libraries for smart mirrors, but none of these off the fleixiblity and full customization I desired. Feel free to build off of this code and/or modify it to create designs that suit you best.
